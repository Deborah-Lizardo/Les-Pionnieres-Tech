        Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955, in London, United Kingdom. He studied Physics at Queen's College, University of Oxford, and began his career as a computer programmer and software engineer. He is best known for inventing the World Wide Web and creating the foundational technologies that allowed the web to grow into the global network we rely on today.

        In 1989, while working at CERN, Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web, a way to link different documents and information using hyperlinks. In 1991, he launched the first website, creating the base for the modern web as we know it. Berners-Lee also created the core web technologies: HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which allow for browsing and information exchange on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization dedicated to developing web standards. W3C’s mission is to ensure that the web remains accessible, open, and interoperable, and has prioritized web accessibility through its guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are used globally to help developers create accessible websites for people with disabilities.

        Berners-Lee has always advocated for a web that is accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. He believes that creating an accessible web is not only a technical best practice but a fundamental human right, as the internet is an essential tool for education, work, and social participation. Through W3C, Berners-Lee helped establish standards to make the web accessible to all, promoting the use of assistive technologies like screen readers, so that people with disabilities can navigate and interact with online content.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is also a strong proponent of a barrier-free internet, where anyone, regardless of ability, can access digital information and resources fairly and equitably.
